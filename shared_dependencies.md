Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Libraries: The Python libraries such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, OpenAI, and PDF generation libraries are shared across multiple files. These libraries are required to be imported in "scrapy_spider.py", "beautifulsoup_scraper.py", "openai_api.py", and "pdf_generator.py".

2. Search URL: The search URL is a shared variable that is passed as an argument to the Python run command. This URL is used in "main.py", "scrapy_spider.py", and "beautifulsoup_scraper.py" for web scraping.

3. Extracted Data: The data extracted from the search engine pages is shared across multiple files. The data is initially extracted in "scrapy_spider.py" or "beautifulsoup_scraper.py", then it is summarized in "openai_api.py", and finally used in "pdf_generator.py" to create the PDF.

4. Summarized Text: The summarized text generated by the OpenAI API is shared between "openai_api.py" and "pdf_generator.py". The text is generated in "openai_api.py" and then used in "pdf_generator.py" to populate the PDF.

5. PDF File: The PDF file is a shared resource that is created in "pdf_generator.py" and its path might be used in "main.py" for further operations or output.

6. Function Names: Functions for scraping (in "scrapy_spider.py" and "beautifulsoup_scraper.py"), summarizing (in "openai_api.py"), and PDF generation (in "pdf_generator.py") might be called from "main.py". These function names are shared dependencies.

7. Requirements.txt: This file contains all the shared Python library dependencies that need to be installed for the project to run.

8. README.md: This file shares the overall description and instructions of the project, which encompasses all the other files.
