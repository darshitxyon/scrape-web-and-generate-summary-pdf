Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Libraries: Both Scrapy and BeautifulSoup are used for web scraping, which are shared across "scrapy_spider.py" and "beautifulsoup_scraper.py". The OpenAI API is used in "openai_api.py" for summarizing the scraped data. The PDF generation in "pdf_generator.py" would require a library like FPDF or PyPDF2. 

2. Search URL: The search URL is a shared input across all the scraping files. It is taken as an argument in "main.py" and passed to the scraping scripts.

3. Scraped Data: The data scraped from the search engine is shared across the scraping scripts, the summarization script, and the PDF generation script. The scraping scripts extract the data, the summarization script processes it, and the PDF generation script uses it to create the PDF.

4. Summarized Data: The summarized data is a shared output from "openai_api.py" and input to "pdf_generator.py". 

5. PDF File: The PDF file is a shared output from "pdf_generator.py" and the final output of "main.py".

6. Function Names: Functions for scraping (in "scrapy_spider.py" and "beautifulsoup_scraper.py"), summarizing (in "openai_api.py"), and PDF generation (in "pdf_generator.py") would be called in "main.py".

7. Requirements.txt: This file contains all the shared dependencies required to run the scripts.

8. README.md: This file would contain instructions on how to run the scripts, which would involve all the shared dependencies and scripts.
