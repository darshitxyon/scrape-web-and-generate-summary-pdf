Shared Dependencies:

1. **Scrapy**: Both "scrapy_spider.py" and "main.py" will use Scrapy for web scraping. 

2. **BeautifulSoup**: "beautifulsoup_scraper.py" and "main.py" will use BeautifulSoup for backup scraping.

3. **OpenAI API**: "openai_api.py" and "main.py" will use OpenAI's API for summarizing the scraped data.

4. **PDF Generator**: "pdf_generator.py" and "main.py" will use a PDF generator to create PDFs from the scraped and summarized data.

5. **Configurations**: "config.py" will contain configurations like the OpenAI API key, the maximum number of links to scrape, the maximum summary length, etc. These configurations will be used by all other files.

6. **Requests**: "scrapy_spider.py", "beautifulsoup_scraper.py", and "openai_api.py" will use the requests library to send HTTP requests.

7. **Exported Variables**: The scraped data, the summarized data, and the generated PDFs will be shared between "scrapy_spider.py", "beautifulsoup_scraper.py", "openai_api.py", "pdf_generator.py", and "main.py".

8. **Function Names**: Functions for scraping (e.g., `scrape_links`, `handle_pagination`), summarizing (e.g., `summarize_text`), and PDF generation (e.g., `generate_pdf`) will be shared between the respective files and "main.py".

9. **Requirements**: "requirements.txt" will list all the Python packages required by the other files.

Note: As this is a Python project, there are no DOM elements, message names, or id names involved.
