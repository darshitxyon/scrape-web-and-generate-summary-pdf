Shared Dependencies:

1. **Scrapy**: Both `scrapy_spider.py` and `main.py` will use Scrapy for web scraping. The spider defined in `scrapy_spider.py` will be used in `main.py`.

2. **BeautifulSoup**: `beautifulsoup_scraper.py` and `main.py` will use BeautifulSoup for backup scraping. The scraper defined in `beautifulsoup_scraper.py` will be used in `main.py`.

3. **OpenAI API**: `openai_api.py` and `main.py` will use OpenAI's API for text summarization. The function defined in `openai_api.py` to interact with the API will be used in `main.py`.

4. **PDF Generator**: `pdf_generator.py` and `main.py` will use the PDF generator. The function defined in `pdf_generator.py` to generate PDFs will be used in `main.py`.

5. **Search URL**: The search URL will be passed as an argument to the python run command in `main.py` and will be used in both `scrapy_spider.py` and `beautifulsoup_scraper.py` to scrape data.

6. **Settings**: `settings.py` will contain settings for Scrapy and will be used in `scrapy_spider.py` and `main.py`.

7. **Scraped Data**: The data scraped from the search engine will be shared between `scrapy_spider.py`/`beautifulsoup_scraper.py`, `openai_api.py` for summarization, and `pdf_generator.py` for PDF generation.

8. **Summarized Text**: The summarized text generated by `openai_api.py` will be used in `pdf_generator.py` to populate the PDF.

9. **Generated PDF**: The PDF generated by `pdf_generator.py` will be used in `main.py` to output the final result.

Function Names:

1. `scrape_data`: Function in `scrapy_spider.py` and `beautifulsoup_scraper.py` to scrape data from the search engine.
2. `summarize_text`: Function in `openai_api.py` to summarize the scraped data.
3. `generate_pdf`: Function in `pdf_generator.py` to generate a PDF from the summarized text.
4. `main`: Function in `main.py` to orchestrate the entire process.
